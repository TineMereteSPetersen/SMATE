            <h2>NPI consulting services</h2>

            <p>Over the past 7 years, we utilize our knowledge and expertise to help clients bring prototypes into
                production, we help navigate through the jungle of Chinese manufacturers, optimize their design for
                low-cost high-quality manufacturing, lead it through global certifications.</p>
            <p>We help make products affordable, reliable and prolong their lifetime. We offer services covering the
                entire NPI process and thus significantly reducing time to market.</p>

                    <div class="centerwrap"><a href="">Production maturing</a></div>
                    <p>The key procedure before final prototyping is design- + BOM-review, DFM and DFT. We help to
                        suggest design optimizations and component alternatives from local suppliers to reduce cost and
                        lead-time, as well as increase manufacturability.</p>

                    <div class="centerwrap"><a href="">Prototype manufacturing</a></div>
                    <p>Before a design can be locked and sent for certification, small series of complete sets of
                        electronics, mechanics and packaging must be produced. The fitting between mechanics and
                        electronics needs to be verified, the efficiency and scalability of the assembly process must be
                        ensured. The factory's internal documentation and procedures for the specific product must be
                        verified and the client must test and optimize the final design, e.g. antenna impedance
                        matching.</p>

                    <div class="centerwrap"><a href="">Certification</a></div>
                    <p>Certification needs to be planned early in the NPI process to avoid delays and trouble during
                        compliance testing. Take advantage of our experience and close connection to SGS in Shenzhen who
                        provides very cost-effective and professional certification services. The key is early risk
                        assessment and pre-testing by hourly renting of SGS’s labs.</p>
